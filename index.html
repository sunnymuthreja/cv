        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Sunny - 34 years of age - son of beloved parents, I have two siblings an older sister and brother. I'm also a proud uncle of three beautiful boys.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about learning new skills and creating 3D art, web designs and helping others getting to their next level. I live in the beautiful city caleld Duesseldorf, in Germany.</p>

        <hr>
        <h2>What do I bring to the table?</h2>
        <p>I am 3D Character Animator, self-taught 3D Artist, Front End Web Developer and a former Mechanical Engineer (specialization in Product Development) turned CAD & PLM Consultant.
            At my day job I support <a href="#">PTC</a>'s <em>(&larr; great place to work)</em> customers with technical as well as educational topics about products like PTCs' PLM Software <a href="#">Windchill</a>.
        </p>
        <p>My passion is to create art in various forms 2D or 3D. The nerd inside of me likes to do wed design and expand my programming skills in Python and expand DCC tools with little helpers that support the creation workflow in DCC applications like MODO. I am also passionate about 3D visualization in general and how companies showcase their products on the market.</p>
        <p>If you are new to 3D/ DCC <em>(digital content creation)</em> and you want to expand your skills or you are already familiar with certain topics and bring your growth mindset, we will have a good time together.</p>
